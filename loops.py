Example:
Suppose you're iterating over a list of numbers, 
and you want to skip the even numbers
but haven't decided what to do with the odd numbers yet. 
You can use pass like this:
'''
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for number in numbers:
    if number % 2 == 0:
        pass  # Skip even numbers
    else:
        print(f"Odd number: {number}")


'''
Finding prime number using For/Else
'''
for number in range(2,100):
	for factor in range(2, int(number **0.5)+1):
		if number % factor == 0:
			break
	else:
		print(f'{number} is prime!')
